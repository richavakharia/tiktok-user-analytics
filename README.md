# TikTok User Analytics

This project simulates the backend of a simple TikTok analytics system using Java. It was developed independently to practice data handling, test-driven development, and foundational data analysis in an object-oriented environment.

## Project Overview

The program reads from a text file of TikTok users and allows the user to:

- Add and remove users
- Retrieve follower and like data
- Save updates to the file
- Run unit tests to verify code functionality

## Key Features

- Java-based GUI for user interaction
- JUnit test cases for method accuracy and edge case handling
- Exception handling for invalid or missing users
- File parsing and dynamic data storage using ArrayList

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JUnit 4.13.2
- Eclipse IDE
- Text file I/O
- Object-oriented design

## Learning Outcomes

- Designed and executed unit tests using JUnit
- Implemented test-driven development (TDD) strategies
- Gained experience in exception handling and file path management
- Built a lightweight, testable application for managing structured user data

## Sample Data

The `Top10TikTokers.txt` file includes sample data of TikTokers and their follower and like counts. It can be edited to include custom entries.

## Running the Application

1. Open the project in Eclipse
2. Run `MyTikTokManagerDemo.java`
3. When prompted, select the `Top10TikTokers.txt` file
4. Use the GUI to manage TikToker data

## Running Unit Tests

1. Right-click on `ArrayListMyTikTokManagerTest.java`
2. Select "Run As" → "JUnit Test"
3. Confirm that all tests pass with a green bar

## Notes

This project was created to apply core software engineering principles in a data-oriented context and to demonstrate testing, file handling, and GUI interaction skills for real-world data science preparation.
